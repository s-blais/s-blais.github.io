<p>I'm a freshly-minted full-stack developer (courtesy of <a href="https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp">Flatiron School</a>), eager to use and expand the fun new tools that I've added to my toolbelt.</p>

<p>I am excited to put my new knowledge to work with a small- to medium-sized team as a junior developer, product/project manager, or techy factotum. Design-emphasized environments particularly resonate with me, as I have worked among designers of many kinds for years.</p>
