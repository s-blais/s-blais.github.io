Several months ago I discovered a cute tabletop puzzle with great parallels to programming. It's ideal for those times when you feel like you should be flexing and building your programming muscles, but don't want to write a single line of code or even sit in front of a computer. 

The reason that [Gravity Maze](http://https://www.thinkfun.com/products/gravity-maze/) works as a programming analog for me is that you are presented with a scenario where you have to get yourself from a known start point, to a known end point, via a prescribed, limited set of intermediate steps. Also, there are sometimes different, but equally valid, ways to solve it. Sound familiar?

The bonus for me is that this puzzle is played in three dimensions, which is often how my brain metaphorically incorporates some concepts in programming. E.g., if an array is like a row of cells in a spreadsheet, then a nested array is like a cell in that row branching a new row, magically, off the two dimensions of your display, toward your face (yes there is some magic-realism liberty taken with that metaphor, but I stand by it, lol).

Now I'm curious about what other programming-but-not-programming leisure activities are out there, hmmm
