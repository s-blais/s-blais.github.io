As a Community-Powered Bootcamp student, my learning experience is a bit different than that of the majority of Bootcamp students. Indeed, not having access to an instructor can sometimes be frustrating and intimidating! The flip side to the "independence" of being a CPB student, however, is that when I can get something working – especially a project that feels as daunting at first as the CLI gem does – I can say "hey! I did that all myself! Not bad!"

Despite what felt like an unnavigable avalanche of newness with the gem format of this project (all these extra files and directories! things are in different places! why is this so weird? Ugh, I'm not sure I remember all those git commands…), I can, in hindsight, say that it ended up being fun. (And, as simple as it may be to simply tap out "learn submit" at the end of the Learn IDE lessons, there is definitely a whiff more of geeky satisfaction when executing a git commit & push to your repo)

I assumed I would get through the requirements and put the project to bed as soon as possible, but instead, after the bare-bones of the program was doing what I wanted it to, I found myself almost compulsively playing with the output, tweaking the presentation, adding sleep statements to implement a "scroll" effect on the article list, and so on – to the point that I had to stop myself and declare it done. Undoubtedly, this is a result of having worked alongside designers for so long (not a bad thing, I recommend it to everyone)!

I'm really enjoying how the coursework is continually pushing me just a bit out of my comfort zone, then proving to me (my proving to myself?) that I actually can do it, then presenting me with another challenge. What's next? Onward!
