Whether blessing or curse (or both!), I've always been the guy who knows a little about everything, who can figure out what the problem is and how to fix it, who can identify a way to make it better, who can make sense of a jumbled mess…

My varied work history reflects my adaptive nature – I've worked with healthcare administration, IT, architects, graphic designers, industrial designers, product designers, visual artists, publishers, marketers – and absorbed valuable skills and knowledge from all of them, that I wouldn't trade for any narrow-yet-lucrative 

Recently, while reflecting on the work environments that I enjoy the most (small- to medium-sized creative enterprises), and pondering what kind of things I could do to level-up my work value game, I happened upon a Flatiron/Yale summer session collaboration course offering. Though the course at Yale was perfect for me on paper, my life logistics simply weren't cooperating to make it happen. But Flatiron had caught my eye, nonetheless!

Considering that a decent proportion of my income for several years was the direct result of some self-taught web skills, Community Bootcamp was a no-brainer. If I was able to execute rewarding work for exercising skills that I picked up from library books and various tutorials, imagine the return-on-investment from a structured, thorough, respected curriculum like Flatiron's Bootcamp, right?

With what feels like an already-impressive number of lessons behind me, and yet many more than that still to go, yes, it's a slog. And a half! Those green rspec test results, however elusive they may be at times, keep me going.

As the complexity and intensity of the lessons ramps up, I'm certainly going to be increasing my participation in the "community" part of Community Bootcamp. I'm eager to engage, collaborate, and network with other students.
