Ah, JavaScript. Like plenty other SE bootcamp students, I struggled a bit when the curriculum progressed from Ruby/Rails to JS. The cozy familiarity of Ruby's cleanliness and readability gave way to what felt like a tortured syntax full of persnickety, extraneous punctuation and a confusing rulebook full of weird "except when" and "but only if" and "yeah, but" frustrations. 

I had, in the past, successfully dabbled in JS both professionally and more recently in Bootcamp Prep. That experience totally eluded me for several weeks, as I seemed to rebuild my JS skillset from scratch. 

I also fretted a bit that my Ruby and Rails skills would suffer during the intense focus on JS, as if someone who had just learned a passing conversational Spanish suddenly found themselves in Italy for several weeks. Some cognates are there, but it's not the same... 

When I started my JS project, it initially felt like something to get out of the way, a tollboth on the highway to program completion. MVP was the name of the game; let's get this done and put to bed...

... Until I inevitably started getting enhancement ideas in my head. I entertained a strong urge to implement edit/update functionality. Then I decided it was impractial to add a separate edit form – couldn't I repurpose my create form? That would require the page to scroll itself back to the form, and open it up. With a minute of research I had ` scrollIntoView ` and ` setAttribute ` ready to go. Hmm, the form needs to repopulate itself with the object being edited; ` value ` took care of that. Oh, the text on the submit button should change too? Done. Clear the form fields with a cancel button? Sure.

This is the point at which I experienced my conversion: "okay, JS, you're pretty cool. I may not be attracted to you physically, but I like your personality." I couldn't believe how quickly I made that slick form conversion come together.

With that win under my belt, I decided to continue further beyond MVP and go full CRUD on my app by implementing a delete function, as well. 

How ironic, how silly-me. The JS project that I gave so much stink-eye – out of a dislike for JS – ultimately made me a fan of JS. I've said this many times in my life, and it rings true, again: often the thing you least want to do is the thing you most need to do.
