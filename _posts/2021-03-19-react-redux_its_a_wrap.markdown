Gosh, it's been a good several months since a blog post requirement has come up for me. Finalizing everything for my React-Redux project – my last project, which closes out my coursework with Flatiron – what an exciting time to write a blog post!

Regarding the project itself, I'm thrilled that it's complete. Intimidated at first, I will admit, I nevertheless realized I would easily fulfill the requirements when I'd sketched out my schema and interface ideas on paper. 

I had good confidence going into the Rails API backend, as it was a similar process to the backend of my JS project. Once that was up and running, and seeded, and successfully serving some JSON, I got started on my frontend. 

Ain't gonna lie, setting up a React-Redux frontend entails the creation and coordination of what feels like a hundred moving parts once you get past the deceptive ease of `npx create-react-app`. A Redux store, and its actions, and its reducers – it wasn't always clear to me which part to do first – but I got there. I didn't need to, but I did namespace my reducers via combineReducers because I have decided that I am smitten with the  simplicity of not having to drill down in my state manipulations in the respective reducers.

Speedbumps? Oh yes; it wouldn't be a project without at least a few, right? While testing POST requests to my API using Postman, I neglected to add some header information and lost hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Soon after that, I also bungled the syntax for when Rails accepts an array in params, and lost a few more hours there. 

With the React and Redux lessons fresh(er) in my mind, I built out my components and rather enjoyed it, pausing multiple times along the way to rename, refactor, and reorganize. 

As with every previous project I've done for Flatiron, I've had to resist countless feature-creep instincts. I have thought of so many different and fun ways to enhance my app with new attributes, views, features, ways to organize, filter, and display the data... yet, I return to the mantra of "MVP, MVP, MVP." Not to mention wanting to experiment with front end styling frameworks  – oh, I could tinker forever. But I must suppress those urges, and forge ahead!

As one of the last students to complete the soon-to-be-closed Community Bootcamp, I want to express my astonishment that I actually did this! It's been a long, and at times lonely, road, but my hard work has opened many doors for me, and I'm looking forward to peeking into as many of them as I can – and, before long, proudly walking through one. Thank you, Flatiron!
