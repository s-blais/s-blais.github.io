No cohort. No Cohort Lead. No mentors. No Technical Coaches available in Ask A Question. No technical interviews. No code reviews. Just how have I managed to make it as far as I have? 

If you'd not already guessed from the title of this blog entry, that's right, the community!

Community-Powered Bootcamp has been a good approach for me for several reasons. It's economical. It's self-paced. There's no Flatiron campus nearby where I live. And initially, it provided a dip-my-toes-in opportunity with the option of silent, painless withdrawal should my old-dog-new-tricks anxieties prove to be grounded in reality... 

Years ago, after being laid off from a job, I taught myself some web and design skills, all from library books. Since I was able to support myself with those skills as a freelancer for several years, I figured my ability to learn "on my own" was reasonably established, and a more formalized curriculum like Flatirons CBP SE would be even better. 

I was right – mostly! This stuff is fun, but it can also be pretty difficult. Programming is a lot more conceptual than the things I've "taught myself" in the past. The tools and raw materials used are complex and intimidating. Something as simple as clicking through to a Stack Overflow page when trying to solve a problem can be an eye-popping, almost-meltdown-inducing exercise in "I think I'm in over my head"... 

During Bootcamp Prep, I had dabbled a bit with the Ask A Question feature, utilizing it as a lifeline for the handful of times that I found myself truly stuck. I attempted being a helpful participant, however it was still all so new to me that I rarely had anything constructive to contribute. Then, after enrolling in Community Bootcamp, it was a definite letdown to have that resource taken away. 

I survived on my ownsome for a good stretch (with Google's help, of course), but then as the lesson/lab complexity increased, I joined Slack. At first blush, it didn't seem to have much potential, as the official Community Bootcamp channel is, ironically, exceptionally quiet. But after exploring some of the other channels, oh wow! All kinds of people, from all over the place, learning a lot of the same things, and a lot of different things too. 

In one channel or another, there is always someone eager to assist or advise, for any flavor or intensity of issue. It's helpful and heartening to read the threads of students getting stuck, and then unstuck with the assistance of their fellow students. And when I get stuck, I turn to the community in Slack first – but not to seek an answer – to give my brain a break and indulge in the milieu of the virtual student body. That alone is sometimes enough for me to break through and get myself unstuck. I'm far enough along now that I'm actually able to help out, too, which feels great. 

This invaluable resource – the other Flatiron students – is an essential piece of the puzzle that makes up my continued progress in the program. I'm about halfway through Bootcamp, and can't imagine continuing without the community. Thank you everyone, and, Onward!
