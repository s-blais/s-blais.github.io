Earlier today, I had a conversation with one of my favorite former coworkers. He's looking for someone to produce a quick app mockup/prototype for a college design class that he is mentoring.

While explaining that I could, technically, help him with this product, it is so much more clearly within the wheelhouse of someone in UI/UX. I recall enough from a tour at Flatiron to know that one of their primary tools is Sketch, so I visited the Sketch website so I could show him how a designer versed in Sketch would be perfectly targeted to his needs. 

Skimming the Sketch site, I thought, ooh, wow, I want to know this! I couldn't help but start to think about how I might be able to complement my SE trajectory with some UI/UX. Side project? Subsequent add-on? Hmmm

Before I enrolled at Flatiron, I wasn't sure which track was best for me, and was vacillating between UI/UX and SE (I'm somewhat grateful that Cybersecurity track hadn't launched yet, because I would have had even more difficultly choosing). I ultimately decided on SE, because there is essentially no coding content in the UI/UX track, and I was determined to learn at least some programming. Since I already have years of experience working with different flavors of design, coding feels like an invaluable skill, at almost any level of proficiency.  But maaaannn, wireframing and prototyping sure look like fun, too!

Without a doubt, at least some of this  sentiment is a direct result of where I am in the curriculum – the start of my Rails project. The projects always feel daunting and a challenge to one's attention span, after dozens of relatively quick-hit lessons and labs. Yes, I am returning to my Rails project in earnest. I am, however, certainly not forgetting the sexy eyes UI/UX cast at me from across the room, and intend to return to them before long to make some small talk. Who knows where that conversation may lead!
