I'm in the running for the most exciting role I've applied for since finishing my bootcamp coursework. It's a contract gig, implementing iOS app localization updates for a pretty cool and successful software company. I love iOS, I love developing on Mac, and I love languages (heck, I minored in linguistics in college). 

Even though I met the applicant minimum requirements to score an initial screening interview with HR, after the interview I found myself a little uncomfortable that I'd never *specifically* executed the main tasks of the position (even if not required for consideration for the position). 

Monday evening, I realized I could easily change that self-perceived shortcoming. I did some cursory research, and decided that Tuesday I would learn how to localize an iOS app using Xcode. 

Among Apple's extensive iOS app development documentation is a [tutorial to develop a tidy little workplace daily-meeting timer](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training). It's a fully-functioning app on its own, however it is not localized; it's a strictly-English affair. Perfect sandbox for experimentation!

Despite ignoring Xcode for several years (since abandoning a pre-Swift-era Objective-C course due to getting a busy new job), I was able to get around reasonably well. Supressing the urge to use all my VSCode keyboard shortcuts required a bit of effort, but the incentives were there – at least several times, I mindlessly flicked a keyboard-shortcut and was shot at supersonic speed into the "oh my god what did I just do" ionosphere! Initially I spent more time referencing documentation to get myself out of situations like that, rather than making progress on the project at hand. 

Before long, I had a functioning ES localization, and soon after that, a FR localization as well. Since then, I've continued to tinker a bit, and smooth over a few rough edges. Of course, I've got it up on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/s-blais/scrumdinger-localized) to show off my experiment (and goose my contributions activity a bit, heh).
