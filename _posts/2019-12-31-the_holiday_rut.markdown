Yikes! It's New Year's Eve!

Seven months ago, I started the Bootcamp Prep Course. Currently, I'm now over 400 lessons deep in Community Bootcamp (I'm pretty chuffed with myself about it, for multiple reasons, not the least of which is permanent dismissal of my old-dog-new-tricks fears). Upwards of fifteen lessons per week, on average. Both summer and fall have come and gone, and here we are officially in winter, with the darkest days of the year just barely behind us. 

I started planning my final Sinatra project over two weeks ago, and initially, made a quite satisfying flurry of commits. My project concept not only fulfills the requirements for the project, but was also functional early on, despite its skeletal state. Just gotta flesh it out and pretty it up. I'd be out of Sinatra and into Rails in no time, right?

Wrong! Never underestimate the roll-slowing capacity of holidays, family, friends, events, parties, travel, visits, aforementioned darkest days of the year, absence of due dates, negligible Slack activity, and no accountability to anyone other than myself. My poor Sinatra project has languished for a couple weeks now, quietly guilting me while various holidaytime daily happenings make each day seem, y'know, just *not quite the right day* for sitting down and writing some code. I've never taken even half this long to complete anything in the curriculum. Ugh.

I'm not happy about this; surely I could have put this lesson and project to bed by now. Yet, hark! Here we are on the eve of not just the new year, but also — and far more significantly to me — the end of holiday season. The end of distractions and excuses and convenient oh-look-how-disrupted-my-routine-is sidesteps. One more party tonight, a wildcard of a day tomorrow, then: back to it, full time, full stop. New year, new skills, new opportunities, new job, new life… go!
